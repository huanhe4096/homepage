# VAHC Homepage

The homepage of VAHC.

The `\docs` folder will be served as the root folder for the homepage.
By using the `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=./VAHC2022/" />` meta tag in the `index.html`, the landing page will redirect visitors to the `VAHC2022` subfolder or anyother location.

GitHub Actions will automatically build the homepage and you can visit it at [https://visualanalyticshealthcare.github.io/VAHC-Homepage/] or use customized domain name.
