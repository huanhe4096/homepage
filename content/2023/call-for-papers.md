Summary: VAHC 2023 Call for papers


CALL FOR PAPERS
============================================

The 2023 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2023) is the 14th annual workshop that provides an opportunity for participants to discuss state-of-the-art interactive visual data analysis techniques and review how such techniques can be applied to healthcare data. The primary objective of the workshop is to bring together leading VIS designers, scientists, medical experts, and visionaries to discuss: a) interactive data visualization techniques that can be applied to healthcare data, b) areas of healthcare that need more attention from visualization and visual data analysis research, and c) emerging research trends, visualization techniques, software applications, benchmarks, and open datasets. The workshop will enable presenters to showcase their ongoing work through oral presentation and system demos, either as video supplemental material or live demos during the workshop to be arranged with the organizers for maximum visibility. In years past, demos of prototype and/or production visual analytics software have been particularly well received, and paper submitters are encouraged to submit a companion demo proposal.


BEST PAPERS
===========

VAHC assigns Best Paper and Honorable Mention awards. The awards entail a certificate and recognition on the VAHC website. This year, we also plan to invite authors of high-quality papers to submit a revised and extended version to an internationally recognized scientific journal. The topic of this special issue will be “Interactive Visualization of Health Data for Digital and Personal Health”. The review process will seek to assign the same reviewers for previously accepted VAHC papers. Watch out for details in our second call for papers.




TOPICS AND SCOPE
================

We welcome discussions of the use of visual approaches, interaction design, statistical methods, and machine learning for healthcare data analysis. Participants may address the needs of various user groups, including (but not limited to) patients, clinical researchers, epidemiologists, public health analysts, physicians, hospital-based quality assurance officers, and insurance claim analysts.

The 2023 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare will cover a range of topics on the design, implementation, deployment, evaluation, and abstraction of visual analytics methods, including (but not limited to):

- Clinical care:
    - Prescription drugs and drug-drug interactions
    - Multi-omic datasets
    - Longitudinal clinical data
    - Visual data mining of EMRs
    - Specific treatment contexts, emergency department, patient safety, mental health.
    - Clinical workflows
    - Outcome forecasting or prediction
    - Explainable AI and ML in healthcare 

- Digital health and personal health
    - Mobile health
    - Wearable devices' data control and processing
    - Telehealth and telemedicine
    - Personalized medicine

- Patient-related applications:
    - Patient-generated health data
    - Understanding of patient behavior and experience 
    - Patient education
    - Physician-patient communication

- Public health data:
